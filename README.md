# BookReviews
This is a collection of book reviews that I've written.
This archive is intended to eventually go my website, when I get round to making one.
The reviews in this repo are the "pure" form of the review, there is acompanying shorter versions on my goodreads account.
Each text file is its own review, including the date (DD-MM-YYYY) that the review was written.

# Reason for doing this?
At the start of the 2023 new year, I realised I hadn't read a book in years. So I made it my new years resolution to read at least 12 books in 2023. In doing so I could improve my reading ability, and learn more about topics im interested in. As well as get entertained by stories.
