“Mind: A Brief Introduction” by John Searle - Reviewed 25th July 2023

This book serves as a good introduction to the philosophy of the mind. 
This book is well written and easy to follow providing you give it full attention.
There’s quite a lot of terminology and ideas that I learned about in this book, such as dualism, 
functionalism, the mind-body problem & the problems of free will to name a few. 
It does a good job of offering solutions to various problems in this area of philosophy, 
and it serves as a good starting point where it shows you areas in which you can read further into.

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the philosophy of the mind.
