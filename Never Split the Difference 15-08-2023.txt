“Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It” by Chris Voss - Reviewed 15th August 2023

This book is written by a former FBI hostage negotiator who talk about the techniques about negotiation
interlacing the analysis with stories from his time as a hostage negotiator 
and stories from his students about using the techniques in day to day life.

The book has changed the way that I’ve viewed some interactions, especially those in the workplace. 
One of the reasons being is a lot of the techniques discussed in the book people do in conversation without realising,
once I became aware of these techniques they’ve become easy to spot.

I would recommend this to anyone as it is highly informative while also being entertaining and easy to read.
