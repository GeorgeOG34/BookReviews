“Nausea” by Jean-Paul Satre - Review Written on 19th June 2023 

This book is a fictional story written in a journal form, 
about a writer/historian Antoine Roquentin who basically experiences an  existential crisis 
and goes a bit insane in waves which come and go, which he calls nausea. 
The book is very good at portraying Roquentin’s thoughts and can often feel like the writing is kind of scattered, 
which paints a good image of the nausea.

The other characters in the book are often introduced with some mystery around them, 
I think this demonstrates how Roquentin feels different from them and isolated.

Overall it was a pretty enjoyable read, and I would recommend it, but I wouldn’t say it's a must read.
