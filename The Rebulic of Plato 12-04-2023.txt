The Republic of Plato - Reviewed on 12th April 2023

This book is a conversation between Socrates and friends discussing justice and injustice. 
I found this book very interesting. Some of the things that stood out was the idea of women being seen as equal, 
I thought this was a relatively new idea and was surprised to see the idea existing over 2000 years ago.
I also enjoyed reading the part about the allegory of the cave, the true inspiration for the matrix. 
Iâ€™d heard about this idea before but reading the full thing was much more interesting.

I also really enjoyed reading how the idealistic society ruled by the philosopher king could fall to despotism.

The book overall was quite a long read, but not super difficult to understand, and quite enjoyable. 
I read it because it is one of the must reads in philosophy and I think that holds true, so I too would recommend it.
