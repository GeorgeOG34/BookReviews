"Philosophy For Beginners" by Richard Osborne - Reviewed 04-06-2023

This book provides a timeline of the history of philosophy, giving small introductions to every part of philosophy. 
It covers all major philosophers and touches on some of their works at a great entry level. 
There's also accompanying illustrations which make it more of a fun read. 
It also talks about how real world events impacted philosophy at that time and vice versa.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it, 
it is an easy read and is also fairly short while still covering an extremely wide range of topics.
It definitely serves as a great stepping stone to see what ideas to read more into.
