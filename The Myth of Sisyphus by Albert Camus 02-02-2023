"The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus" - Reviewed on 2nd February 2023

This is a book, or rather a philosophical essay, that aims to answer and talk about one problem and that is suicide.
This book entails the philosophy of absurdism. 

The absurd is “the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, 
and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless and irrational universe”.
 
 The book has a powerful opening sentence “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. 
 Judging whether life is or is not worthing living amounts to answering the fundamental questions of philosophy”.

This book accepts nihilism, the lack of objective inherent meaning, value & matter, as a fundamental truth. 
From this truth arises the question of suicide. To which the author draws three answers to the question; suicide, philosophical suicide and absurdism.
The book then continues to talk in large about the absurd man and the idea of absurdism. 
The absurd man is someone who sees the nihilistic truth and continues to live in an act revolut.

An interesting point that the author brings up is that by revolution you should revolut until death naturally occurs,
because there is no objective way of measuring the quality of a life, but there is an objective way in measuring a quantity. 
Which I thought was an interesting idea, I’m not sure if I agree with that aspect, 
but on the whole I think my underlying philosophy tends to lean towards absurdism.

Overall I think the essay was a pretty hard read, and I probably should have read other things before reading this, 
but since I already had a fairly ok understanding of a lot of this stuff I was able to digest and understand what I was reading. 
I would definitely recommend it, but only if you already have some knowledge on existential philosophy
