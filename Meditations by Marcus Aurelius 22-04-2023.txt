Meditations by Marcus Aurelius - Reviewed on 22nd April 2023

This is a book that was written by a Roman Emperor and was never intended to be read. 
Due to this it has a very unique style of writing; It's written as a list in the context of a kind of journal. 
The whole book is about stoic philosophy but more specifically what he has learned and 
what he thinks about how to live.

I like initially how he starts by talking about the people in his life and
how they impacted him and what he was able to learn. 
The list then further contains what a person ought to do and how they ought to behave providing reasons as to why 
he thinks it is the correct way. The book covers aspects of stoic philosophy in an easy to digest way, 
and I found there were often repeating ideas, which is good as it can help build your understanding of his outlook on life.

Going into this I didnâ€™t know much about stoic philosophy but 
now I feel as though I have a pretty decent understanding of what stoicism is about,
at least from the view of Marcus Aurelius. 
I would recommend this book for those interested in finding out what stoicism is 
and how it can be applied as he talks about it in a practical way. 
It was also a fairly easy and enjoyable read.
